This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked bug in PHP: the unexpected behavior of loose comparison operators (`==`) when comparing strings and booleans. The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version using strict comparison (`===`).  The loose comparison can lead to logical errors that are difficult to debug.  Always prefer strict comparison for clearer and more predictable code.
